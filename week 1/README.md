Objective: Students will learn to generate synthetic data using a simple generative method and implement it using Python.
Experiment 1: Implement a Simple Generative Algorithm for Data Generation
Generative AI models are capable of creating new data samples. In this experiment, students will use a pre-trained generative model to generate synthetic data samples and store them for further use.
Instructions:
1.	Select any domain for data generation (example: image data generation).
2.	Choose any pre-trained generative model (example: Stable Diffusion / any diffusion model).
3.	Provide input prompts (at least 5).
4.	Generate synthetic data using the model.
5.	Save generated output in a folder/dataset format.
6.	Display sample outputs 
Output
A synthetic dataset will be generated.
